A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data.

   abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C 6 · R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Grimme2010,
   abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The sub-200 cm−1 (sub-6 THz) vibrations of molecular crystals provide identifying features that are characteristic of each solid sample under study. These distinctive vibrational spectra have driven the development of new techniques and instrumentation in analytical spectroscopy. As terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy become increasingly prevalent in non-specialist laboratories, the need for a common set of spectral standards for use across these techniques becomes imperative. To meet this need, \(\alpha\)-lactose monohydrate, biotin, and L-cystine are proposed here as molecular standards to evaluate instrument performance with both terahertz and Raman spectroscopies, as well serve as benchmarks for quantum mechanical simulations and analyses of these spectra. These substances all reveal a series of readily discernable peaks across the low-frequency region and also over a range of temperatures (295–50 K) making them even more useful. The often overlooked aspect of detailed spectral interpretation and assignment is directly addressed with rigorous solid-state density functional theory simulations of the three compounds based on a standard computational framework. By investigating these proposed molecular crystal standards with commonly available experimental and theoretical approaches, a set of realistic performance expectations can be achieved for both commercial instrumentation and software being used in low-frequency vibrational spectroscopy.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li 4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community.

   abstract = {A technique for calculating the optical constants of powdered materials that have been pressed into pellets along with a diluent such as polyethylene, as is commonly used in the spectroscopy community, is introduced. The simple Beer-Lambert law typically used to calculate the optical constants has the inherent weakness that it treats the absorbing medium as a single nonporous solid, as opposed to a dielectric material embedded within a medium. This leads to a systematic underestimation of both the absorption coefficient and the refractive index, especially at low filling factors. Effective medium theory provides a way to calculate more accurate optical constants and produces similar optical constants across a wide range of filling factors, including crucially at the low filling factors commonly used experimentally. The technique can also be extended to estimate the porosity of the samples and provide a true, preparation-independent value for the optical properties of the sample material.},

Comparison of the results from the different methods highlights the problems of calculating the absorption spectrum reliably. In particular the low frequency phonon modes are especially sensitive to the choice of grids to represent the wavefunction or the charge distribution, k-point integration grid and the energy cutoff. A comparison is made between the Maxwell-Garnett (MG) and Bruggeman effective medium methods used to account for the effect of crystal shape on the predicted spectrum. Possible scattering of light by air inclusions in the sample and by larger particles of Na2(SO4)2 is also considered using the Mie method.

Most of the absorption peaks from the simulation correspond well with those from the measurements. By calculating the spatial and time-dependent energy accumulation in the molecular system, the core idea of our calculation method is further validated. Compared with the ab initio calculations, our method provides a computationally inexpensive way to accurately predict the locations of absorption features.

This requires either single crystals or high-quality single-phase powder X-ray diffraction data. The present contribution demonstrates a novel method to reconstruct single-phase powder diffraction data from diffraction patterns of mixtures of several components and subsequently to determine the individual crystal structures. The new method does not require recourse to any database of known materials but relies purely on numerical separation of the mixture data into individual component diffractograms. The resulting diffractograms can subsequently be treated like single-phase powder diffraction data, i.e. indexing, structure solution and Rietveld refinement. This development opens up a host of new opportunities in materials science and related areas. For example, crystal structures can now be determined at much earlier stages when only impure samples or polymorphic mixtures are available. © 2014.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to improve tabletability (tensile strength versus compaction pressure) of \(\alpha\)-lactose monohydrate by twin screw extrusion (TSE) near its dehydration temperature but below its melting point. When extruded at 150 and 160 °C, \(\alpha\)-lactose monohydrate converted completely to \(\alpha\)-lactose anhydrous that was mostly crystalline and only partially amorphous; the latter was indicated by glass transition observed in DSC scans. Tabletability of the material thus obtained by TSE was superior to anhydrous lactose available commercially or produced by hot air oven drying at 160 °C. The superior tabletability was attributed to the partial conversion to amorphous lactose. When samples of anhydrous lactose powders obtained by TSE or oven drying were exposed to 25 °C/60\% RH and 40 °C/75\% RH, they reverted to the monohydrate with decreased tabletability. However, when anhydrous lactose powders produced by TSE were first compressed into tablets with high tensile strength and then exposed to similar stability testing conditions, there was no decrease in the tensile strength of tablets. Rather, it further increased, possibly due to the interaction of the amorphous fraction of lactose with moisture. Thus, TSE not only increased tabletability of \(\alpha\)-lactose monohydrate, the compressed tablets remained intact and hard during shelf-life. These results demonstrate that a new modified anhydrous lactose may be produced by TSE that has better tabletability and superior physical stability than \(\alpha\)-lactose monohydrate and the commercially available anhydrous lactose.},

These approaches are used to derive macroscopic observables under the controlled condition of a ``computational experiment,'' and with a predictive power rooted in the quantum-mechanical description of interacting atoms and electrons. Density-functional theory (DFT) has become de facto the method of choice for most applications, due to its combination of reasonable scaling with system size and good accuracy in reproducing most ground state properties. Such an electronic-structure approach can then be combined with classical molecular dynamics to provide an accurate description of thermodynamic properties and phase stability, atomic dynamics, and chemical reactions, or as a tool to sample the features of a potential energy surface.",

   abstract = {The potential of terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) to predict the dissolution performance in sustained-release tablets was investigated in this study. Batches of coated tablets with similar weight gain during the coating process at the lab and pilot scales were subjected to non-destructive imaging by TPI and subsequently analysed by dissolution testing. The results from the dissolution tests revealed significant differences in the product performance between the lab and pilot scales (Student t-test, P<0.05). The model-independent dissolution parameters in the pilot scale showed a prolonged mean dissolution time. This indicated that the pharmaceutical active ingredient was released at a slower rate in the pilot compared to the lab scale. While weight gain measurements (the traditional coating quality parameter), failed to provide an early indication of the product functional performance; terahertz parameters (terahertz electric field peak strength and coating layer thickness) provided insight into the subsequent dissolution behaviour. Correlations between terahertz parameters and dissolution were much stronger than correlations between weight gain and dissolution; with the R(2) value for terahertz correlations typically around 0.84 as opposed to 0.07 for weight gain correlations. This study presents the initial finding of correlations between terahertz parameters for assessing the coating quality to the dissolution performance of the coated tablet. The contributing factors for these particular correlations are also discussed.},

Because of these characteristic properties, there has been an increasing interest in terahertz imaging and spectroscopy for biological applications within the last few years and more and more terahertz spectra are being reported, including spectroscopic studies of cancer. The presence of cancer often causes increased blood supply to affected tissues and a local increase in tissue water content may be observed: this acts as a natural contrast mechanism for terahertz imaging of cancer. Furthermore the structural changes that occur in affected tissues have also been shown to contribute to terahertz image contrast.

   abstract = {Because of the functionality of controlled release tablet coatings, it is desirable to have a rapid means of optimizing coating conditions and predicting the performance of a batch at-line, prior to exhaustive lab analysis. In this paper, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) was utilized for the first time as a rapid means of simultaneously determining the thickness and uniformity of an enteric coating on compressed tablets. In these studies, the core tablets contained a high concentration of calcium, and the coating contained titanium, silicon, and magnesium, all of which are excellent analytical targets for LIBS. The emission spectra of all four elements were simultaneously monitored as a function of the number of laser pulses in the same spatial location, literally drilling through the coating and into the core tablet. The depth penetration of individual laser pulses was calibrated using profilometry, and the thickness of the coating was determined by the incidence of calcium signal and simultaneous decrease in emission from the other probe elements (titanium, silicon and magnesium) as the laser penetrated the coating. Coating thickness measurements were evaluated by sampling coatings ranging from 5 to 21\% (100 mg tablet weight basis). Additionally, LIBS spatial resolution capabilities were exploited to evaluate the film coat thickness uniformity across the tablet faces and edges. Furthermore, tablet to tablet uniformity differences were readily assessable. The results indicate that a change in coating application of less than 2 wt.\% on a 100 mg tablet can be easily detected. The rapid analysis times for this technique (10 tablets were analyzed in under 15 min) makes it applicable for in-process evaluation of coating thickness, as well as intra- and inter-tablet coating uniformity on compressed tablets.},

   abstract = {We present in-line coating thickness measurements acquired simultaneously using 2 independent sensing modalities: terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Both techniques are sufficiently fast to resolve the coating thickness of individual pharmaceutical tablets in situ during the film coating operation, and both techniques are direct structural imaging techniques that do not require multivariate calibration. The TPI sensor is suitable to measure coatings greater than 50 \(\mu\)m and can penetrate through thick coatings even in the presence of pigments over a wide range of excipients. Due to the long wavelength, terahertz radiation is not affected by scattering from dust within the coater. In contrast, OCT can resolve coating layers as thin as 20 \(\mu\)m and is capable of measuring the intratablet coating uniformity and the intertablet coating thickness distribution within the coating pan. However, the OCT technique is less robust when it comes to the compatibility with excipients, dust, and potentially the maximum coating thickness that can be resolved. Using a custom-built laboratory scale coating unit, the coating thickness measurements were acquired independently by the TPI and OCT sensors throughout a film coating operation. Results of the in-line TPI and OCT measurements were compared against one another and validated with off-line TPI and weight gain measurements. Compared with other process analytical technology sensors, such as near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy, the TPI and OCT sensors can resolve the intertablet thickness distribution based on sampling a significant fraction of the tablet populations in the process. By combining 2 complementary sensing modalities, it was possible to seamlessly monitor the coating process over the range of film thickness from 20 \(\mu\)m to greater than 250 \(\mu\)m.},

   abstract = {Terahertz spectroscopy and imaging have developed rapidly over the past decade as versatile analytical tools for the characterisation of drug delivery systems. In this chapter the technology that has enabled the recent surge of interest in using terahertz techniques is explained in terms of its basic principles and the specific implementations of pharmaceutical relevance. Using a number of examples and case studies an overview of the current state-of-the-art applications of terahertz radiation in pharmaceutics is presented. In the field of spectroscopy this ranges from polymorph detection and quantification, detailed analysis of phase transitions to amorphous stability. Important imaging applications include non-destructive coating thickness measurements, characterisation of the microstructure of tablet matrices as well as liquid transport into tablets during disintegration.},

   abstract = {Low-frequency vibrational modes of biological molecules consist of intramolecular modes, which are dependent on the molecule as a whole, as well as intermolecular modes, which arise from hydrogen-bonding interactions and van der Waals forces. Vibrational modes thus contain important information about conformation dynamics of biological molecules, and can also be used for identification purposes. However, conventional Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) often result in broad, overlapping features that are difficult to distinguish. The technique of waveguide THz-TDS has been recently developed, resulting in sharper features. For this technique, an ordered polycrystalline film of the molecule is formed on a metal sample plate. This plate is incorporated into a metal parallel-plate waveguide and probed via waveguide THz-TDS. The planar order of the film reduces the inhomogeneous broadening, and cooling of the samples to 77K reduces the homogenous broadening. This combination results in the line-narrowing of THz vibrational modes, in some cases to an unprecedented degree. Here, this technique has been demonstrated with seven small biological molecules, thymine, deoxycytidine, adenosine, D-glucose, tryptophan, glycine, and L-alanine. The successful demonstration of this technique shows the possibilities and promise for future studies of internal vibrational modes of large biological molecules.},

The absorption coefficient as a function of frequency was determined and compared with theoretical predictions and available water vapor absorption data. The prediction code is able to separately model the different parts of atmospheric absorption for a range of experimental conditions. A variety of conditions were accurately modeled using this code including both self and foreign gas broadening for low and high water vapor pressures for many different measurement techniques. The intensity and location of the observed absorption lines were also in good agreement with spectral databases. However, there was a discrepancy between the resonant line spectrum simulation and the observed absorption spectrum in the atmospheric transmission windows caused by the continuum absorption. A small discrepancy remained even after using the best available data from the literature to account for the continuum absorption. From the experimental and resonant line simulation spectra the air-broadening continuum parameter was calculated and compared with values available in the literature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Five broad absorption peaks were observed at 0.69, 1.08, 1.27, 1.47 and 1.64 THz respectively. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been performed for the isolated urea molecule, and there is no infrared intensity in the region below 1.8 THz. This means that single molecule calculations are failure to predict the experimental spectra of urea crystals. To simulate these spectra, calculations on a cluster of seven urea molecules using M06-2X and B3LYP-D3 are performed, and we found that M06-2X perform better. The observed THz vibrational modes are assigned to bending and torsional modes related to the intermolecular H-bond interactions with the help of potential energy distribution (PED) method. Using the reduced-density-gradient (RDG) analysis, the positions and types of intermolecular H-bond interactions in urea crystals are visualized. Therefore, we can confirm that terahertz spectroscopy can be used as an effective means to detect intermolecular H-bond interactions in molecular crystals.},

@article{Ruggiero2016,
   abstract = {Anharmonicity has been shown to be an important piece of the fundamental framework that dictates numerous observable phenomena. In particular, anharmonicity is the driving force of vibrational relaxation processes, mechanisms that are integral to the proper function of numerous chemical processes. However, elucidating its origins has proven difficult due to experimental and theoretical challenges, specifically related to separating the anharmonic contributions from other unrelated effects. While no one technique is particularly suited for providing a complete picture of anharmonicity, by combining multiple complementary methods such a characterization can be made. In this study the role of individual atomic interactions on the anharmonic properties of crystalline purine, the building block of many DNA and RNA nucleobases, is studied by experimental terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). In particular, the detailed vibrational information provided by the DFT calculations is used to interpret the atomic origins of anharmonic-related effects as determined by the AIMD calculations, which are in good agreement with the experimental data. The results highlight that anharmonicity is especially pronounced in the intermolecular interactions, particularly along the amine hydrogen bond coordinate, and yields valuable insight into what is similarly observed complex biosystems and crystalline solids. ■ INTRODUCTION Molecular vibrations, including their relaxation dynamics, play a vital role in chemical processes where they are often responsible for transporting energy throughout a system, for example during catalysis, structural reorientation, and biomolecular ligand binding events. 1−6 Vibrational relaxation can be incredibly complex, with motions propagating through hundreds, to even thousands, of atoms within very short time periods (<1 ps). 7,8 Despite this, the fundamental origins of these relaxation pathways can be traced to the anharmonicity of individual vibrations, a property that allows for coupling between two (or more) modes. 9−12 Such is the case in DNA and RNA, where it has been suggested that vibrational relaxation, originating from anharmonicity in the amine hydrogen bonds of the bases, is critical for dissipating the energy from electronic absorption events, important for maintaining structural and chemical integrity. 13−17 Recent work has shown that relaxation in Watson−Crick bases is greatly enhanced through intermolecular interactions, indicating that both the molecular and bulk potential energy landscapes must be well understood in order to fully comprehend anharmonic coupling in DNA and RNA. 16,17 But while a great deal is known about these interactions from bulk-phase experiments, the contributions from individual atoms or functional groups is difficult to achieve with high accuracy. 18−23 On the other hand, crystalline materials offer the advantage of having a well-defined, regular structure, enabling the extraction of very precise atomic-level details regarding the forces present. 24−26 Moreover, the dynamics observed in complex biomolecules are often similarly present in crystalline solids and thus provide an excellent opportunity for detailed study. 27,28 And although biomolecular systems like DNA are not typically static nor do they exhibit long-range order, there does exist a significant amount of localized order on the molecular level, i.e., base pairing and stacking, 29−31 which is precisely where anharmonicity effects are believed to originate. Crystalline purine (Figure 1) contains many of the same interaction types that are found in nature, 32 specifically the same amine hydrogen bonding pattern that is believed to be the source of anharmonic-related effects in DNA, and is an excellent model system to explore how individual anharmonic interatomic potentials can influence bulk properties. Yet even the use of crystalline materials does not simplify the characterization of anharmonicity, neither experimentally nor},

In this study, we used a standardized in vivo porcine burn model to obtain terahertz (THz) point-spectroscopy measurements from burns with various severities. We then extracted two reflection hyperspectral parameters, namely spectral area under the curve between approximately 0.1 and 0.9 THz (10 dB bandwidth in each spectrum), and spectral slope, to characterize each burn. Using a linear combination of these two parameters, we accurately classified deep partial- and superficial partial-thickness burns (p = 0.0159), compared to vimentin immunohistochemistry as the gold standard for burn depth determination.},

This process enabled the demarcation of a wound center for each THz image, independent of THz contrast. Threshold based segmentation enabled the automated identification of air (0\% reflectivity), brass (100\% reflectivity), and abdomen regions within the registered THz images. Pixel populations, defined by the segmentations, informed unsupervised image calibration and contrast warping for display.

   abstract = {Over the last two decades, regulatory agencies have demanded better understanding of pharmaceutical products and processes by implementing new technological approaches, such as process analytical technology (PAT). Process analysers present a key PAT tool, which enables effective process monitoring, and thus improved process control of medicinal product manufacturing. Process analysers applicable in pharmaceutical coating unit operations are comprehensibly described in the present article. The review is focused on monitoring of solid oral dosage forms during film coating in two most commonly used coating systems, i.e. pan and fluid bed coaters. Brief theoretical background and critical overview of process analysers used for real-time or near real-time (in-, on-, at- line) monitoring of critical quality attributes of film coated dosage forms are presented. Besides well recognized spectroscopic methods (NIR and Raman spectroscopy), other techniques, which have made a significant breakthrough in recent years, are discussed (terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI), chord length distribution (CLD) analysis, and image analysis). Last part of the review is dedicated to novel techniques with high potential to become valuable PAT tools in the future (optical coherence tomography (OCT), acoustic emission (AE), microwave resonance (MR), and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)).},

   abstract = {Cocrystal is constructed to improve physicochemical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredient and prevent polymorphism via intermolecular interactions. However, recent examples on cocrystal polymorphs display significantly different properties. Even though some analytical techniques have been used to characterize the cocrystal polymorphic system, it remains unclear how intermolecular interactions drive and stabilize the structure. In this work, we study the cocrystal polymorphs of nifedipine (NFD) and isonicotinamide (INA) using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Form I and form II of NFD-INA cocrystals show spectral fingerprints in THz region. Temperature-dependent THz spectra display distinguished frequency shifts of each fingerprint. Combined with solid-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the experimental fingerprints and their distinct responses to temperature are elucidated by specific collective vibrational modes. The vibrations of hydrogen bonding between dihydropyridine ring of NFD and INA are generally distributed below 1.5 THz, which play important roles in stabilizing cocrystal and preventing the oxidation of NFD. The rotations of methyl group in NFD are widely distributed in the range of 1.5–4.0 THz, which helps the steric recognition. The results demonstrate that THz spectroscopy is a sensitive tool to discriminate cocrystal polymorphs. It has the potential to be used as a non-invasive technique for pharmaceutical screening.},

   abstract = {The structural properties of a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, lacidipine, were explored by combining lowerature X-ray diffraction with optical vibrational spectroscopy and periodic density functional theory (PBC DFT) calculations. Crystallographic analysis cannot discriminate between two possible molecular symmetries in crystals made of pure lacipidine: the space group Ama2, where the lacipidine molecule lies on mirror symmetry, or a Cc space group with distorted lacipidine molecules. Intermolecular interactions analysis reveals an infinite net of moderate-strength N-H···O hydrogen-bonds, which link the molecular units toward the crystallographic b-axis. Weak interactions were identified, revealing their role in stabilization of the crystal structure. The vibrational dynamics of lacidipine was thoroughly explored by combining infrared and Raman spectroscopy in the middle- and low-wavenumber range. The given interpretation was fully supported by state-of-the-art solid-state density functional theory calculations (plane-wave DFT), giving deep insight into the vibrational response and providing a complex assignment of spectral features. The vibrational analysis was extended onto the lattice-phonon range by employing time-domain terahertz spectroscopy. Analysis of the anisotropic displacement parameters suggests noticeable dynamics of the terminal (tert-butoxycarbonyl)vinyl moiety. The terahertz study provides direct experimental evidence of crankshaft type motions in the terminal chain. By combining low-wavenumber vibrational spectroscopy with the first-principles calculations, we were able to prove that the quoted thermodynamically stable phase corresponds to the monoclinic Cc space group.},

   abstract = {Characterising the structural dynamics of proteins and the effects of excipients are critical for optimising the design of formulations. In this work we investigated four lyophilised formulations containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and three formulations containing a monoclonal antibody (mAb, here mAb1), and explored the role of the excipients polysorbate 80, sucrose, trehalose, and arginine on stabilising proteins. By performing temperature variable terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) experiments it is possible to study the vibrational dynamics of these formulations. The THz-TDS measurements reveal two distinct glass transition processes in all tested formulations. The lower temperature transition, Tg,β, is associated with the onset of local motion due to the secondary relaxation whilst the higher temperature transition, Tg,\(\alpha\), marks the onset of the \(\alpha\)-relaxation. For some of the formulations, containing globular BSA as well as mAb1, the absorption at terahertz frequencies does not increase further at temperatures above Tg,\(\alpha\). Such behaviour is in contrast to our previous observations for small organic molecules as well as linear polymers where absorption is always observed to steadily increase with temperature due to the stronger absorption of terahertz radiation by more mobile dipoles. The absence of such further increase in absorption with higher temperatures therefore suggests a localised confinement of the protein/excipient matrix at high temperatures that hinders any further increase in mobility. We found that subtle changes in excipient composition had an effect on the transition temperatures Tg,\(\alpha\) and Tg,\(\beta\) as well as the vibrational confinement in the solid state. Further work is required to establish the potential significance of the vibrational confinement in the solid state on formulation stability and chemical degradation as well as what role the excipients play in achieving such confinement.},

We have used terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to measure the full dielectric function of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose and the disaccharide sucrose in the frequency range 0.54.0 THz (16-130 cm-1). In polycrystalline sugars we observe a series of distinct absorption lines originating from the lowest intermolecular vibrational modes, whereas in amorphous sugars a broad, featureless absorption spectrum is observed. Our measurement of an anomalous temperature dependence of the absorption line positions in both protonated and deuterated sucrose shows that the effective potential of the weakest intermolecular vibrational modes in sucrose is determined by a balance between the hydrogen bond strength and van der Waals forces. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We developed a phase-locking scheme for such lasers to significantly enhance their radiative efficiency and beam quality. An array of metallic microcavities is longitudinally coupled through traveling plasmon waves, which leads to radiation in a single spectral mode and a diffraction limited single-lobed beam in the surface normal direction. We implemented our scheme for terahertz plasmonic quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) and measured peak output power in excess of 2W for a single-mode 3.3THz QCL radiating in a narrow single-lobed beam, when operated at 58K in a compact Stirling cooler. We thereby demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in power and thirty-times higher average intensity for monolithic single-mode terahertz QCLs compared to prior work. The number of photons radiated from the cavity outnumber those absorbed within its claddings and semiconductor medium, which constitutes &gt;50\% radiative efficiency and is significantly greater than that achieved for previous single-mode mid-infrared or terahertz QCLs.},

However, since these nanowires have small contact area, the nanowires fill factor in the photomixer active region is low, which leads to reduce the nanowires conductivity. In this work, we proposed to add graphene nanoantenna array as nanoelectrodes to the silver nanowires-based photomixer to improve the conductivity. In addition, the graphene nanoantenna array and the silver nanowires form new hybrid nanoelectrodes for the CW-THz photomixer leading to improve the device conversion efficiency by the plasmonic effect. Two types of graphene nanoantenna array are proposed in two separate photomixer configurations. These are the graphene nanodisk (GND) array and the graphene bow-tie nanoantenna (GNA) array. The photomixer active region is simulated using the computer simulation technology (CST) Studio Suite® for three optical wavelengths: 780 nm, 810 nm, and 850 nm. From the results, we found that the electric field in the active region is enhanced by 4.2 and 4.8 times for the aforementioned configurations, respectively. We also showed that the THz output power can be enhanced by 310 and 530 times, respectively. This is an open access article under the CC BY-SA license.},

The invention of THz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) was a major breakthrough to bridge the so-called ‘THz gap’ between semiconductor electronic and photonic sources. However, their demanding cooling requirement has confined the technology to a laboratory environment. A portable and high-power THz laser system will have a qualitative impact on applications in medical imaging, communications, quality control, security and biochemistry. Here, by adopting a design strategy that achieves a clean three-level system, we have developed THz QCLs (at 4 THz) with a maximum operating temperature of 250 K. The high operating temperature enables portable THz systems to perform real-time imaging with a room-temperature THz camera, as well as fast spectral measurements with a room-temperature detector. GaAs-based terahertz quantum cascade lasers emitting around 4 THz are demonstrated up to 250 K without a magnetic field. To elevate the operation temperature, carrier leakage channels are reduced by carefully designing the quantum well structures.},

It is essential to build upon this success and to maintain the mission momentum towards achieving a high readiness level (TRL) and eventual flight. A key step in this process is the demonstration and proof of operation of the THz payload in a representative environment (towards TRL 6). We therefore have begun working on a hi-fidelity breadboard of the LOCUS payload suitable for both extensive laboratory and environmental testing, and with a potential for deployment on a high-altitude platform, such as NASAs Global Hawk. The latter will prove the system technical operation in a closely representative environment, and will return valuable and useful scientific data.

As such, these sources are particularly suited to the application of THz frequency imaging across a range of disciplines, and have motivated significant research interest in this area over the past decade. In this paper we review the technological approaches to THz QCL-based imaging and the key advancements within this field. We discuss in detail a number of imaging approaches targeted to application areas including multiple-frequency transmission and diffuse reflection imaging for the spectral mapping of targets; as well as coherent approaches based on the self-mixing phenomenon in THz QCLs for long-range imaging, three-dimensional imaging, materials analysis, and high-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

While OF can result in undesirable and unpredictable operation in laser systems, it can also cause measurable perturbations to the operating parameters, which can be harnessed for metrological purposes. In this work we exploit this ‘self-mixing’ effect to infer the emission spectrum of a semiconductor laser using a laser-feedback interferometer, in which the terminal voltage of the laser is used to coherently sample the reinjected field. We demonstrate this approach using a terahertz frequency quantum cascade laser operating in both single- and multiple-longitudinal mode regimes, and are able to resolve spectral features not reliably resolved using traditional Fourier transform spectroscopy. We also investigate quantitatively the frequency perturbation of individual laser modes under OF, and find excellent agreement with predictions of the excess phase equation central to the theory of lasers under OF.},

A significant advantage offered by terahertz quantum cascade lasers lies in the potential to integrate them with other components on the same chip. Such terahertz photonic integrated circuits would help close the terahertz technology gap between microwave electronics and infrared photonics. Here, we describe the first successful monolithic integration of a terahertz quantum cascade laser and diode mixer to form a simple but generically useful terahertz photonic integrated circuit—a microelectronic terahertz transceiver. We show that this terahertz photonic integrated circuit performs all the basic functions (for example, transmission of a coherent carrier, heterodyne reception of an external signal, frequency locking and tuning) of discrete-component terahertz photonic systems, but at a small fraction of the size and in a robust platform scalable to semiconductor fabrication production. A terahertz quantum cascade laser and diode mixer are monolithically integrated to form a simple microelectronic terahertz transceiver. The performance of this system — the transmission of a coherent carrier, heterodyne reception of an external signal, frequency locking and tuning — is as efficient as that of discrete component terahertz photonic systems.},

Further progress towards the realization of devices operating at higher temperatures and emitting at longer wavelengths (sub-terahertz quantum cascade lasers) is difficult because it requires maintaining a population inversion between closely spaced electronic sub-bands (1nbsp;THznbsp;≈nbsp;4&nbsp;meV). Here, we demonstrate a magnetic-field-assisted quantum cascade laser based on the resonant-phonon design.

To address this, the proposed work introduces PC THz emitters based on textured InP materials. The enhanced surface recombination and decreased charge-carrier lifetimes of the textured InP materials reduce residual photocurrents, following the picosecond THz waveform generation and this diminishes Joule heating in the emitters. A non-textured InP material is used as a baseline for studies of fine- and coarse-textured InP materials. Ultrafast pump-probe and THz setups are used to measure the charge-carrier lifetimes and THz response/photocurrent consumption of the respective materials and emitters. It is found that similar temporal and spectral characteristics can be achieved with the THz emitters, but the level of photocurrent consumption (yielding Joule heating) is greatly reduced in the textured materials.},

   abstract = {In this paper we perform a configuration-space analysis of the local-density approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation energy functional of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory in terms of the corresponding average exchange-correlation charge (hole) and energy densities. According to our analysis, the explanation for the quantitative success of the LDA based on the hole charge-conservation sum rule and the assumed consequent cancellation of errors in the spherical averages of the hole is inadequate. The principal conclusion of our work is that the constraint of charge neutrality is a necessary but not sufficient condition for an approximate energy functional to lead to accurate ground-state energies and ionization potentials. The significant additional requirement for the functional is that it must, at least qualitatively, reproduce correctly the structure of the hole as a function of electron position. We perform our calculations within the exchange-only approximation as applied to atoms and jellium metal surfaces. In atoms the Fermi hole is localized about the nucleus; as a consequence the LDA Fermi hole is accurate only for electron positions close to it. However, we show that the spherically averaged LDA hole is accurate for electron positions in the shell regions; it is substantially in error in the intershell and classically forbidden regions. The fact that the principal contribution to the exchange energy comes from the inner-shell region of the atom, where the LDA hole is accurate, explains why the errors in the LDA ground-state energies are small. However, the ionization potential, which depends on the structure of the hole in the outer regions of the atom, is substantially in error in the LDA since here the LDA hole differs significantly from the exact one. For metallic surfaces, on the other hand, as an electron is pulled from within the metal to infinity outside, the Fermi hole is delocalized and spread throughout the crystal. As a consequence, the planar-averaged LDA hole, which is accurate for electron positions inside the metal, bears little resemblance to the exact hole for electron positions outside the surface. Thus the planar-averaged LDA energy density in the regions at and outside the surface, from which there is a significant contribution to the energy, is poor, and consequently so is the surface exchange energy. However, the LDA work function is accurate since the surface dipole barrier is fairly insensitive to the choice of the approximate energy functional. Finally, our calculations exhibit a striking similarity in the structure of the exact spherically averaged Fermi holes for the few-electron-atomic and many-electron-metallic-surface nonuniform systems, thus demonstrating the truly universal nature of the exact energy functional. © 1988 The American Physical Society.},

The PRDDO, STO-3G, and reference SCF (ref SCF) calculations are found to be consistently in close agreement for relative total energies, orbital eigenvalues, atomic charges, and dipole moments. The CNDO/2 and INDO calculations, in contrast, were frequently in serious disagreement with both the reference calculations and experiment. PRDDO is found to be 16 times faster than STO-3G and MOO times faster than the ref SCF calculations for a molecule having 40 atomic orbitals, while CNDO/2 and INDO, in turn, are times faster than PRDDO. Detailed comparisons show that PRDDO eliminates over 90\% of the CNDO/2 or INDO error while requiring an additional computing time which is only about 6\% of that required by STO-3G. The VRDDO method is essentially equal in accuracy to STO-3G, but is only slightly faster than STO-3G. The VRDDO/MODPOT combination is approximately twice as accurate as PRDDO, but is 5 times slower. Finally, the ESE MO (SBD/2C) and AAMOM methods are somewhat faster but less accurate than PRDDO, and the SBD/3C version of ESE MO is both slower and less accurate. © 1978, American Chemical Society.

   abstract = {During the past decade, computer simulations based on a quantum-mechanical description of the interactions between electrons and between electrons and atomic nuclei have developed an increasingly important impact on solid-state physics and chemistry and on materials science - promoting not only a deeper understanding, but also the possibility to contribute significantly to materials design for future technologies. This development is based on two important columns: (i) The improved description of electronic many-body effects within density-functional theory (DFT) and the upcoming post-DFT methods. (ii) The implementation of the new functionals and many-body techniques within highly efficient, stable, and versatile computer codes, which allow to exploit the potential of modern computer architectures. In this review, I discuss the implementation of various DFT functionals [local-density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid functional mixing DFT, and exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange] and post-DFT approaches [DFT + U for strong electronic correlations in narrow bands, many-body perturbation theory (GW) for quasiparticle spectra, dynamical correlation effects via the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (AC-FDT)] in the Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP. VASP is a plane-wave all-electron code using the projector-augmented wave method to describe the electron-core interaction. The code uses fast iterative techniques for the diagonalization of the DFT Hamiltonian and allows to perform total-energy calculations and structural optimizations for systems with thousands of atoms and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for ensembles with a few hundred atoms extending over several tens of ps. Applications in many different areas (structure and phase stability, mechanical and dynamical properties, liquids, glasses and quasicrystals, magnetism and magnetic nanostructures, semiconductors and insulators, surfaces, interfaces and thin films, chemical reactions, and catalysis) are reviewed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The experimental data were used to validate the DFT simulations by probing the spectral dynamics of the low-energy vibrational modes in a broad temperature range. Principal component analysis (PCA) and individual peak analysis were also used to further elucidate temperature-induced changes. Given the nature of the conducted theoretical calculations, LFR measurements in a cold environment proved especially useful to accurately assess their quality due to complex, temperature-induced spectral dynamics for most of the investigated compounds (especially, l-tyrosine).},

In this work, we have performed an extensive experimental and computational study on the molecular solid camphor, which exhibits a rich and complex structure-dynamics relationship, and undergoes an order-disorder transition near ambient conditions. The combination of x-ray diffraction, variable temperature and pressure terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, ab initio molecular dynamics, and periodic density functional theory calculations enables a complete picture of the phase transition to be obtained, inclusive of mechanistic, structural, and thermodynamic phenomena. Additionally, the low-frequency vibrations of a disordered solid are characterized for the first time with atomic-level precision, uncovering a clear link between such motions and the phase transformation. Overall, this combination of methods allows for significant details to be obtained for disordered solids and the associated transformations, providing a framework that can be directly applied for a wide range of similar systems.},

   abstract = {Crystalline barbituric acid dihydrate (BTADH) was previously thought to undergo a subtle temperature-dependent phase transition from a high-temperature orthorhombic Pnma space group to a nonmerohedrally twinned monoclinic P21/n phase below a transition temperature of 217 K. Questions remain on the true nature of the unusual transformation and the structure of the high-temperature crystal phase due to difficulties in resolving the Pnma structure from X-ray diffraction data and because of the subtlety of the structural transition. In this study, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and solid-state density functional theory (DFT) were utilized to explore this suspected phase transition and uncover the principle physical mechanisms contributing to this anomalous transition. Our findings suggest that at temperatures above the previously reported phase transition temperature of 217 K, the crystal does not exist in the Pnma space group configuration. However, two equivalent favorable energetic states with P21/n symmetry related by the twinning plane lie on either side of the proposed Pnma structure. It is these same local potential energy minima that guide the crystal system to a nonmerohedrally twinned configuration identified in the low-temperature crystal structures. At temperatures above 217 K, the system possesses the thermal energy necessary to readily transition between these degenerate states separated by the low-lying Pnma structural barrier. The evidence acquired by THz spectroscopy and DFT indicate the absence of a true temperature-dependent phase change, and rather a system that exists in a tenuous thermally disordered state above the previously alleged transition temperature.},

With some specific examples here, it has been shown that how closely the different properties of nanomaterials (such as optical, optoelectronics, catalytic and magnetic) predicted by DFT calculations match well with the experimentally determined values. Some examples were discussed in detail to inspire the experimental scientists to conduct DFT-based calculations along with the experiments to derive a better understanding of the experimentally obtained results as well as to predict the properties of the nanomaterial.

We find that the transferred devices show higher optical-to-THz conversion efficiencies and significantly larger breakdown fields, which we attribute to reduced parasitic current in the substrate. Through these improvements, we demonstrate a factor of 8 increase in emitted THz field strength at the maximum operating voltage. In addition we find improved performance when these devices are used for photoconductive detection, which we explain through a combination of reduced parasitic substrate currents and reduced space-charge build-up in the device.},

   abstract = {The solvation shell is essential for the folding and function of proteins, but how it contributes to protein misfolding and aggregation has still to be elucidated. We show that the mobility of solvation shell H2O molecules influences the aggregation rate of the amyloid protein α-synuclein (αSyn), a protein associated with Parkinson's disease. When the mobility of H2O within the solvation shell is reduced by the presence of NaCl, αSyn aggregation rate increases. Conversely, in the presence CsI the mobility of the solvation shell is increased and αSyn aggregation is reduced. Changing the solvent from H2O to D2O leads to increased aggregation rates, indicating a solvent driven effect. We show the increased aggregation rate is not directly due to a change in the structural conformations of αSyn, it is also influenced by a reduction in both the H2O mobility and αSyn mobility. We propose that reduced mobility of αSyn contributes to increased aggregation by promoting intermolecular interactions.},

Recent demonstrations, using pulsed near-infrared femtosecond laser systems, of the viability of THz medical imaging and spectroscopy have sparked international interest; yet much research still needs to be undertaken to optimize both the power and bandwidth in such THz systems. In this paper, we review how femtosecond near-infrared laser pulses can be converted into broad band THz radiation using semiconductor crystals, and discuss in depth the optimization of one specific generation mechanism based on ultra-fast transport of electrons and holes at a semiconductor surface. We also outline a few of the opportunities for a technology that can address a diverse range of challenges spanning the physical and biological sciences, and note the continuing need for the development of solid state, continuous wave, THz sources which operate at room temperature.},

   abstract = {The photo-Dember effect is a source of pulsed THz emission following femtosecond pulsed optical excitation. The emission results from the ultrafast spatial separation of electron-hole pairs in carrier gradients due to their different diffusion coefficients. The associated time dependent polarization of the photo-carriers within the photo-Dember emitters is oriented perpendicular to the excited surface. THz emission under photo-excitation can also be due to the surface field effect or optical rectification. We review the studies that attempt to understand surge current and study the surface emission of different semiconductor materials. We also review the work that has been done on increasing the efficiency of THz surface emitters using plasmonic interactions and other resonant effects. We later focus on a new THz emission mechanism called lateral photo-Dember which proposes a scheme for generating strong carrier current parallel to the excited surface, using the Dember field as well as dipole quenching effect. Because the resulting currents are oriented parallel to the surface and the THz radiation is emitted collinearly to the optical excitation. Surprisingly, the lateral photo-Dember THz emitters provide a higher bandwidth than photoconductive emitters. The theory for the mechanism of emission is reviewed and the parameters that affect the performance of the lateral photo-Dember emitters, namely fluence and polarization, are summarized. Finally we review multiplexing geometries with periodically tailored photo-excited spatial carrier distributions that create phase coherent photo-Dember and surface field currents which enhance the THz emission. These multiple emitters can reach electric field amplitudes comparable to a high-efficiency externally biased photoconductive emitter. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

While the former is a mean-field approach, where each vibrational mode interacts with the average potential of the others, the latter allows for an explicit and complete account of mode-mode correlation. Both schemes are based on the representation of the adiabatic potential energy surface (PES) discussed in Part I, where the PES is expanded in a Taylor's series so as to include up to cubic and quartic terms. The VSCF and VCI methods are formally presented and their numerical parameters discussed. In particular, the convergence of computed anharmonic vibrational states, within the VCI method, is investigated as a function of the truncation of the expansion of the nuclear wave function. The correctness and effectiveness of the implementation is discussed by comparing with available theoretical and experimental data on both molecular and periodic systems. The effect of the adopted basis set and exchange-correlation functional in the description of the PES on computed anharmonic vibrational states is also addressed.},

A unified approach for calculating and assigning vibrational frequencies is developed and applied to solve some historical issues of benzene vibration. As a major achievement, the experimental frequencies of benzene a2g and b2u vibrations are reassigned, which breaks a deadlock in contemporary spectroscopic science and removes a cloud over the application of density-functional theory in organic chemistry. This work paves the way for the comprehensive realization of the first-principles spectroscopic research, and provides crucial clues to solve the century-old problems of Kekule resonance, \(\pi\)-deformation, and aromaticity.},

The observed shifts are in the range of 0.1–0.2 THz. The form of the temperature dependence is well accounted for by a Bose–Einstein model, from which the zero-temperature frequency of each mode and the characteristic temperature of the associated phonon bath may be estimated. At 6 K a fourth band is evident, at 2.65 THz. However, the depth of this, touching the noise floor, coupled with the increasing opacity of the sample with temperature for frequencies beyond 2.5 THz, makes it difficult to track. The frequencies of all four modes are in good accord with and thus confirm a previous calculation.},

   abstract = {We investigate fabrication of compacts using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyethylene (PE), and the effect of compaction conditions on their terahertz transmission properties. The conditions used to fabricate compressed powder samples for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) can impact the accuracy of the measurements and hence the interpretation of results. This study investigated the effect of compaction conditions on the accuracy of the THz-TDS analysis. Two polymers that are commonly used as matrix materials in terahertz spectroscopy studies were explored using a compaction simulator and a hydraulic press for sample preparation. THz-TDS was used to determine the refractive index and loss coefficient to compare the powder compacts (pellets) to the values of solid material. Sample porosity, axial relaxation and tensile strength were measured to assess the material&rsquo;s suitability for terahertz spectroscopy. It was found that PTFE is the preferable material for creating THz-TDS samples due to its low porosity and high tensile strength. PE was found to show significant porosity at all compaction pressures, making it an unsuitable material for the accurate determination of optical parameters from THz-TDS spectroscopy measurements. The larger particle sizes of PE resulted in compacts that exhibited significantly lower tensile strength than those made from PTFE making handling and storage difficult.},

The study is performed for a testing set of 22 low-temperature crystalline phases whose properties such as densities of phonon states, isobaric heat capacities, and densities are computed as functions of temperature within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Electronic structure and lattice dynamics are treated by plane-wave based calculations with optPBE-vdW functional. Comparison of calculated results with reliable critically assessed experimental data is especially emphasized. (Graph Presented).},

   abstract = {Thermal properties of gas hydrates and their underlying fundamental characterization are limited and incomplete but crucial in ongoing basic science research and technological applications. The constant volume heat capacity, the constant pressure heat capacity, the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, and the Grüneisen parameter of methane, ethane, ethylene oxide, carbon dioxide, and empty structure I hydrates, and of hexagonal ice, as functions of temperature from 0 to 300 K, were calculated using the integration of density functional theory (DFT) simulations at 0 K and phonon calculations at higher temperatures. At low temperatures, DFT predictions replicated experimental values of constant pressure heat capacity for hydrates and ice accurately. Notably, the constant volume heat capacity was lower than when compared with literature values calculated with molecular dynamics (MD) and closer to actual data. Guest molecules were found to contribute slightly more than their ideal gas heat capacities to the overall property of the system. DFT underestimated the thermal expansion coefficient in all cases. The ethane and carbon dioxide hydrates demonstrated behavior that was markedly different when compared to methane and empty hydrates, and hexagonal ice. The Grüneisen parameter was calculated for all systems. DFT overestimated the value of the parameter for filled hydrates and hexagonal ice when compared to experimental hexagonal ice values. Altogether, this systematic atomistic study contributes to the technological applications and basic material science of these crystals whose properties are of significant importance in the fields of energy and the environment and provides a potential input to MD simulations thanks to its performance at low temperatures.},

   abstract = {The layered semiconductor SnSe is one of the highest-performing thermoelectric materials known. We demonstrate, through a first-principles lattice-dynamics study, that the high-temperature Cmcm phase is a dynamic average over lower-symmetry minima separated by very small energetic barriers. Compared to the low-temperature Pnma phase, the Cmcm phase displays a phonon softening and enhanced three-phonon scattering, leading to an anharmonic damping of the low-frequency modes and hence the thermal transport. We develop a renormalization scheme to quantify the effect of the soft modes on the calculated properties, and confirm that the anharmonicity is an inherent feature of the Cmcm phase. These results suggest a design concept for thermal insulators and thermoelectric materials, based on displacive instabilities, and highlight the power of lattice-dynamics calculations for materials characterization.},

   abstract = {The identification of isotopic labels by conventional macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolution and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements. We recorded the vibrational spectra of an a amino acid, L-alanine, with damage-free “aloof” electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to directly resolve carbon-site-specific isotopic labels in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution. An isotopic red shift of 4.8 ± 0.4 milli-electron volts in C-O asymmetric stretching modes was observed for 13 C-labeled L-alanine at the carboxylate carbon site, which was confirmed by macroscopic infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.The accurate measurement of this shift opens the door to nondestructive, site-specific, spatially resolved identification of isotopically labeled molecules with the electron microscope.},

   abstract = {The unpolarized absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the fundamental vibrational transitions of the chiral molecule 4-methyl-2-oxetanone are calculated ab initio. Harmonic force fields are obtained using density functional theory (DFT), MP2 and SCF methodologies, and a [5s4p2d/3s2p] (TZ2P) basis set. DFT calculations use the LSDA, BLYP, and Becke3LYP (B3LYP) density functionals. Mid-IR spectra predicted using LSDA, BLYP, and B3LYP force fields are of significantly different quality, the B3LYP force field yielding spectra in clearly superior, and overall excellent, agreement with experiment. The MP2 force field yields spectra in slightly worse agreement with experiment than the B3LYP force field. The SCF force field yields spectra in poor agreement with experiment. The basis set dependence of B3LYP force fields is also explored: the 6-31G* and TZ2P basis sets give very similar results while the 3-21G basis set yields spectra in substantially worse agreement with experiment. © 1994 American Chemical Society.},
