Firstly, I want to extend my enormous gratitude to Dr. Andrew Burnett who was my primary supervisor throughout my PhD and my Masters project. His support, guidance and patience has been invaluable throughout and I will forever be thankful for everything. Not only did he provide vital knowledge and direction but he also assisted with motivation and perspective when, owing to various difficult challenges during the PhD, these were not substantial.

I would also like to extend my thanks to Dr. Aniela Dunn, Dr. Thomas Gill, Dr. Joshua Freeman and Dr. David Bacon, as well as the other members of the University of Leeds Terahertz Group, for providing their expertise and assistance when I was often out of my depth. From monitoring me in the clean room to endlessly diagnosing issues with the various experimental set-ups, their help was a critical element of my success in this project.

To my parents, and by extension my siblings and their children, your unwavering support over the last few years has made this project possible. Thank you so much for helping me attain this monumental achievement. 

Finally, to my friends old and new. Thank you all for the wonderful times over the last few years. In particular, I would like to thank my friends Sam and Emma, who were there for me at every step and who kept me happy and alive during those critical junctures. 

Thank you, again, everyone.
